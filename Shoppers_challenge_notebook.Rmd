## Exploratory analysis
#### trainHistory.csv

Read file in and show first five rows:
```{r}
# read trainHistory.csv in
train<-read.csv("data/trainHistory.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")

head(train)
```

Preprocess the data set a little:
```{r}
# Convert necesary columns to factors
train[,1:4]<-lapply(train[,1:4],as.factor)
```

The response rate for each offer (t means responded and f is the opporsite):
```{r. response rate}
# Calculate response rate
T<-addmargins(table(train$offer,train$repeater))
round(prop.table(T,margin=1),3)*200
```
